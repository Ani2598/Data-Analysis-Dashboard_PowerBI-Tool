# Performance Analysis of DCR Assessments
# Project Objective
 The primary objective of these dashboards is to analyze and visualize the performance of students across different grades and subjects (English, Math, and Science) in the DCR (Digital Classroom) assessments. The analysis aims to:
- Provide insights into average performance across grades and subjects.
- Highlight variability (using standard deviation) in student performance.
-  Bifurcate performance data based on school types (CPS and STM) for comparative analysis.

# Key Questions (KPIs)
- What is the average performance of students in English, Math, and Science across grades?
- How does the performance vary (standard deviation) among students within each grade and subject?
- What is the distribution of schools and students across CPS and STM types?
- How many students attempted the assessments, and what is their grade-wise performance trend?
 
# Process

- Data Aggregation:

- Collect grade-wise and subject-wise assessment scores for English, Math, and Science.
- Group data by grades and school types (CPS/STM).
- Data Cleaning:

- Remove invalid or incomplete entries (e.g., unattempted assessments).
- Standardize performance metrics to percentages for uniform comparison.
- Visualization:

- Use Stacked Column and Line charts to represent average and Standard Deviation percentage scores across grades and subjects.
- Include slicers for school type (CPS/STM) and attempts for easy filtering.
- Include Drill Through for schools to see performance each school wise.
- Dashboard Development:

- Create summary KPIs for total students, school types, and attempts.
- Display detailed grade-wise analysis for further insights.
# Insights
- Average Performance Trends:

- Performance varies significantly across subjects, with Math generally showing higher averages compared to English and Science.
- Grade 9 and Grade 10 students display better performance in English and Math compared to lower grades.
- Variability in Scores:

- Standard deviations indicate higher variability in Science scores, suggesting a need to standardize teaching methods or improve support resources.
- English performance variability is lower, indicating more consistency across students.
  
- Key Challenges:

- Lower averages in Science across all grades may signal a gap in understanding or delivery of the subject.
- Grades 5 and 6 show significantly lower performance overall, indicating the need for targeted interventions.
