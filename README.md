# Performance Analysis of DCR Assessments
# Project Objective
 The primary objective of these dashboards is to analyze and visualize the performance of students across different grades and subjects (English, Math, and Science) in the DCR (Digital Classroom) assessments. The analysis aims to:
1)Provide insights into average performance across grades and subjects.
2)Highlight variability (using standard deviation) in student performance.
3)Bifurcate performance data based on school types (CPS and STM) for comparative analysis.
#Key Questions (KPIs)
1)What is the average performance of students in English, Math, and Science across grades?
2)How does the performance vary (standard deviation) among students within each grade and subject?
3)What is the distribution of schools and students across CPS and STM types?
4)How many students attempted the assessments, and what is their grade-wise performance trend?
